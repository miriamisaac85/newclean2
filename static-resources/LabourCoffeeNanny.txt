A steak pun is a rare medium well done.
I'm tired of following my dreams. I'm just going to ask them where they are going and meet up with them later.
Why did the tomato blush? Because it saw the salad dressing.
Why does a Moon-rock taste better than an Earth-rock? Because it's a little meteor.
Why do birds fly south for the winter? Because it's too far to walk.
