Did you know that protons have mass? I didn't even know they were catholic.
Why is Peter Pan always flying? Because he Neverlands.
Why does a Moon-rock taste better than an Earth-rock? Because it's a little meteor.
I knew I shouldn't steal a mixer from work, but it was a whisk I was willing to take.
To be Frank, I'd have to change my name.
Why is Peter Pan always flying? Because he Neverlands.
Why is Peter Pan always flying? Because he Neverlands.
Slept like a log last night  woke up in the fireplace.
I knew I shouldn't steal a mixer from work, but it was a whisk I was willing to take.
I'm tired of following my dreams. I'm just going to ask them where they are going and meet up with them later.
