What is a centipedes's favorite Beatle song?  I want to hold your hand, hand, hand, hand...
My first time using an elevator was an uplifting experience. The second time let me down.
Why was it called the dark ages? Because of all the knights. 
Why didnt the skeleton cross the road? Because he had no guts.
Why do birds fly south for the winter? Because it's too far to walk.
To be Frank, I'd have to change my name.
