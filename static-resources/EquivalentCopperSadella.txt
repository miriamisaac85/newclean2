How come the stadium got hot after the game? Because all of the fans left.
I was fired from the keyboard factory yesterday.  I wasn't putting in enough shifts.
I thought my wife was joking when she said she'd leave me if I didn't stop signing "I'm A Believer"... Then I saw her face.
Whoever invented the knock-knock joke should get a no bell prize.
